üêª Welcome to My GitHub! üêª

Hello! I'm Jose Guzman (He/Him/His).

I am a recent graduate with a Master of Science in Data Analytics from Northwest Missouri State University, where I honed my skills in statistical analysis, data visualization, and data-driven decision-making. I also completed a Backend Software Development and Data Engineering Bootcamp at Promineo Tech, where I gained hands-on experience with various programming languages and data engineering tools.

With over 10 years of experience in IT, primarily in Helpdesk and Desktop Support roles within higher education and tech, I bring a strong foundation in technical troubleshooting and a passion for leveraging data to solve complex problems. My journey in data analytics is fueled by a commitment to continuous learning and a drive to apply data insights to real-world challenges.
